Location of paired-end reads after adapter trimming: /Users/boselab/Documents/Michael/Sequencing/Genomes-isolates/G4A_S11_L001/QC1-trimming
Location of paired-end reads after digital normalization:/Users/boselab/Documents/Michael/Sequencing/Genomes-isolates/G4A_S11_L001/QC2-normalization
Working on assessing the quality of various genome assemblers using paired-end Illumina 2x250 data. The G4A genome is a Rhodovulum strain
sequenced at Woods Hole. I've been doing comparative genomic analysis on a Velvet (k51) assembly. Today I would like to run assemblies using SPAdes
and possibly SOAPdenovo (maybe others?), then do some comparisons of the quality of these assemblies using QUAST (http://bioinf.spbau.ru/quast).

The data I will be using is both the Trimmed PE read data, but also the digitally normalized data.

All data from these assemblies will be stored here: /Users/boselab/Documents/Michael/Sequencing/G4A_assembly
